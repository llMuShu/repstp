It is my lady.
Give me, give me!
What, not a word?
By'r Lady, thirty years.
More validity, More honorable state, more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo.
You are a saucy boy.
Marry, that ‘marry’ is the very theme I came to talk of.
A plague o' both your houses!
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; The lady widow of Vitruvio; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; Mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
What is the Prince's doom?
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
Is he gone and hath nothing?
I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
Now heaven hath all,
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, But not possess'd it; and though I am sold, Not yet enjoy'd.
This is as't should be.
Mine shall be spent, When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Doth she not count her blest, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
the cords That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Come on then, let's to bed.
At thy good heart's oppression.
Hang him, Jack!
As I did sleep under this yew tree here, I dreamt my master and another fought, And that my master slew him.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s?
What is yond gentleman?
Is she not proud?
Mass, and well said.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare— It is enough I may but call her mine.
Why, bride!
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter.
My child is yet a stranger in the world.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
He made you for a highway to my bed; But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring, their head, their true descent; And then will I be general of your woes And lead you even to death.
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!
Art thou a man?
I pro- test unto thee— Good heart, and i’ faith I will tell her as much.
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord?
The people in the street cry ‘Romeo,’ Some ‘Juliet,’ and some ‘Paris’; and all run, With open outcry, toward our monument.
How now, my headstrong?
I met the youthful lord at Laurence’ cell And gave him what becomed love I might, Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Cry but ‘Ay me!’ pronounce but ‘love’ and ‘dove’; Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, My true love's passion.
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
Come, stir, stir, stir!
Let them begin.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
O noble prince, I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
May not one speak?
Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica; Spare not for cost.
Good Romeo, hide thyself.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
This shall forbid it.
We'll to dinner thither.
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Ready to go, but never to return.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.
Was I with you there for the goose?
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
Love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
Were of an age.
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Arms, take your last embrace.
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Meagre were his looks, Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, An alligator stuff'd, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
and strength shall help afford.
My father Capulet will have it so, And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
O woeful day, O woeful day!
Romeo, hist!
Serve God.
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell Be shrived and married.
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
Make haste, I say.
Ay, ay, the cords.
Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!
I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Methinks I see thee now, thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
There art thou happy.
I wot well where he is.
Where is my lord?
I dare not, sir.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this knife I'll help it presently.
I will kiss thy lips.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Why, how now, Juliet?
By the hour of nine.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
One fairer than my love?
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
Let's see for means.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news.
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
Tis no time to play now.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not, nor I look'd not for.
It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
Bid her devise some means to come to shrift This afternoon; And there she shall at Friar Laurence’ cell Be shriv'd and married.
O me, O me!
You tallow face!
Out alas!
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Madam, I am here.
Thou art like one of those fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee!” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need.
Farewell, my coz.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
I was hurt under your arm.
and how doth she?
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
O rude unthankfulness!
What say'st thou?
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou shalt hear our counsel.
Without his roe, like a dried herring.
Happily met, my lady and my wife.
Perchance she cannot meet him.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Nay, that’s not so.
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.
What can he say in this?
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
I am not for this ambling.
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe thee.
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) A sleeping potion; which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death.
Is your man secret?
What hast thou there?
Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!
forbear this outrage!
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Therefore love moderately.
Tis not to me she speaks.
Do as I bid thee, go.
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
Not in a grave, To lay one in, another out to have.
A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
He speaks not true.
And stay, good Nurse.
Here's goodly gear!
It is not yet near day.
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
I will not entertain so bad a thought.
I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right— Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
Meantime I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come as this dire night, To help to take her from her borrowed grave, Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.
Not life, but love in death.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
Wilt thou slay thyself?
I serve as good a man as you.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned—I never shall forget it— Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
Hath Romeo slain himself?
This is well.
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding, My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding; But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
His son is thirty.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
Romeo, I come!
O, give me thy hand, One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.
And she's fair I love.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
A plague o’ both your houses!
Why, such is love’s transgression.
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
I hate the word, As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night.
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
How canst thou try them so?
Let me be ta'en.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge, Myself condemnèd and myself excused.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me?
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, Thou pout’st upon thy fortune and thy love.
Commend me to your daughter.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
There's no trust, No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd, All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Hang him, Jack!
O my brother’s child!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it.
It is “music with her silver sound” because musicians have no gold for sounding.
Thou shalt be loggerhead.Good faith,'tis day.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
By my heel, I care not.
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
They have made worms' meat of me.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Open the tomb.
No, not till Thursday.
My master is the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled much misfortune bodes This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage.
All are punish'd.
Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
Some grief shows much of love, But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
Dost thou love me?
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will.
To answer that, I should confess to you.
We cannot be here and there too.
Juliet, the County stays.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
Go and trim her up.
Fly hence and leave me.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time, Give me some present counsel; or, behold, 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that Which the commission of thy years and art Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Towards Phoebus’ lodging!
What sayst thou, my dear Nurse?
Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed, Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
Affliction is enamour’d of thy parts, And thou art wedded to calamity.
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Do you quarrel, sir?
We’ll keep no great ado, a friend or two.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd” Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.
Thou!
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
O cousin, cousin!
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles.
Brother, ho!
Commend me to thy mistress.
What a head have I!
O trespass sweetly urg'd!
dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
Do you like this haste?
Hast thou slain Tybalt?
I am the greatest, able to do least, Yet most suspected, as the time and place Doth make against me, of this direful murder; And here I stand, both to impeach and purge Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
That were some spite; my invocation Is fair and honest: in his mistress’ name, I conjure only but to raise up him.
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
all men call thee fickle.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
What says Romeo?
O that she knew she were!
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
What wilt thou tell her, nurse?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, And where care lodges sleep will never lie; But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
Thou villain Capulet!—Hold me not, let me go.
The what?
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!
Peace, you mumbling fool!
What says Romeo?
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek!
Nay, that's not so.
Well, what was yours?
O, how my heart abhors To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him, To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
I think she will be rul'd In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
O Lord, they fight!
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Say thou but “ay,” And that bare vowel  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime's by action dignified.
Muffle me, night, awhile.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.— O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; And Paris too.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Have you delivered to her our decree?
Marry, ’tis enough.
Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John.
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?
I am not I, if there be such an ‘I’; Or those eyes shut that make thee answer ‘I.’ If he be slain, say ‘I’; or if not, ‘no.’ Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Nay, as they dare.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
No words can that woe sound.
Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead!
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!
For himself to mar,” quoth he?
I will not fail.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, Which to the high topgallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Commend me to thy lady.
O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
Can you not conceive?
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
