I will carry no crotchets.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
Why, how now, kinsman?
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
Send thy man away.
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Oh, what learning is!
Wash they his wounds with tears?
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; And by-and-by my master drew on him; And then I ran away to call the watch.
O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot?
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. 
What noise is this?
If thou be merciful, Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.
Commend me to thy lady, And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
wolvish-ravening lamb!
Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads.
Hark, how they knock!
Yet, if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false.
Tell me, good my friend, What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls?
Stay, fellow.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried.— Go, tell the Prince.
I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.
Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath As violently as hasty powder fir'd Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. 
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts!
I will bring you thither.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.
Meaning, to curtsy.
Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Tis he, that villain Romeo.
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot.
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature.
Wilt thou be gone?
How long hath he been there?
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Then have at you with my wit!
God shield I should disturb devotion!— Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.
here lies the County slain; And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain this two days buried.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Romeo will answer it.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, what more favour can I do to thee Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Who knocks so hard?
Have you delivered to her our decree?
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
Yon light is not daylight; I know it, I.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.
or I'll cry a match.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
I strike quickly, being moved.
It is an honor that I dream not of.
Romeo, away, be gone!
what, are you mad?
Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “ay.” And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name When I, thy three-hours’ wife, have mangled it?
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
I will give you the minstrel.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.
Ah, the immortal passado!
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents.
I promise you, but for your company, I would have been abed an hour ago.
Look, and thou shalt see.
Oh, thou art deceived.
She speaks, yet she says nothing.
Alack the day!
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests, and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon.
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine, Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
The lady stirs.
A plague o' both your houses!
Come hither, Nurse.
O, she's rich in beauty; only poor That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.
Here’s such a coil.
Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married?
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Be merciful, say ‘death’; For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.
Came he not home tonight?
More light and light—more dark and dark our woes!
Quarrel, sir?
Go, be gone.
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
Thou dost not mark me.
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come.
I take thee at thy word.
Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
Give me thy torch, boy.
Sole monarch of the universal earth, Oh, what a beast was I to chide at him!
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.
Come hither, man.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
A’ was a merry man) took up the child.
Is it my lady mother?
My naked weapon is out.
O, I cry you mercy!
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
I beseech you, follow straight.
And where the worser is predominant, Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
But saying o'er what I have said before.
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
O, I am slain!
Thus with a kiss I die.
My wits faints.
What a man are you?
What with a torch!
That’s not so.
Hast thou met with him?
I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Young son, it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
I'll look to like, if looking liking move; But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Come hither, Nurse.
Or shall we on without apology?
Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.— Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.
I like it not.
Faith, I know not what to say.
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.
Parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
By my troth, it is well said.
Therefore, have done.
But I pray, can you read any thing you see?
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken.
Peter, stay at the gate.
Now I’ll tell you without asking.
Call her forth to me.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
this sight of death is as a bell That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
What, drawn, and talk of peace?
I do bite my thumb, sir.
But when I came, some minute ere the time Of her awaking, here untimely lay The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes—these new tuners of accent!
Clubs, bills, and partisans!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Yet ‘banished’?
The bridegroom he is come already.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me That's by me wounded.
My back a' t' other side.
I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement.
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Thou art not conquer'd.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.
Hie you to the cell.
The other did not so.
And why, my Lady Wisdom?
All men call thee fickle.
Is thy news good or bad?
Death’s the end of all.
O woful time!
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
I’ll to dinner.
I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self— Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his, And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers’ tears.
Let’s see for means.
Can you not stay awhile?
We follow thee.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; And hither shall he come; and he and I Will watch thy waking, and that very night Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
Romeo's a dishclout to him.
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair, Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Is love a tender thing?
Anon.
By-and-by, I come.— To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
Why, such is love's transgression.
It is not yet near day.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Hang thee, young baggage!
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek!
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth— And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four— She is not fourteen.
Not in a grave To lay one in, another out to have.
Oh, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
If ever you disturb our streets again, Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Out on her, hilding!
Hence, and stand aloof.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Take no note of him.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
Faith, here it is.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage— The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Ay, forsooth.
Capulet, Montage, See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
Raise up the Montagues.
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad?
Rest you merry!
Therefore, farewell.
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
How is't, my soul?
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man.
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
The second cock hath crowed.
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
Why, I am glad on't.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can lick their fingers.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
What said my man when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode?
I will say for you.
So thrive my soul— A thousand times good night!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
They have made worms’ meat of me.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
for thou art As glorious to this night, being o'er my head, As is a winged messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O, pale!
O' Thursday be it, then.— Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
I would forget it fain; But O, it presses to my memory Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds!
What must be shall be.
You lie.
These are news indeed!
Hie to high fortune!
O, tell me, friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
Come, thou day in night, For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Then all alone At the prefixed hour of her waking Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; Meaning to keep her closely at my cell Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Wherefore weep I then?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
What is her mother?
Were you by when it began?
He fights as you sing pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom!
Do not deny to him that you love me.
I'll re you, I'll fa you.
O, tell not me of fear!
What, dost thou make us minstrels?
Then have at you with my wit.
A conduit, girl?
But sadly, tell me who.
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels' monument.
why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
You know not what you do.
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st— A damned saint, an honourable villain!
Even so lies she, Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
I will follow you.
I’ll to the friar to know his remedy.
Fie, you slug-abed!
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death, ‘Romeo is banished’— to speak that word Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, All slain, all dead.
Hast thou not a word of joy?
A plague o’ both your houses!
There rust and let me die.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.—Lord, Lord!
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
The ground is bloody.—Search about the churchyard.
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
Smatter with your gossips, go.
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Hie to your chamber.
It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.
Then, window, let day in and let life out.
His son was but a ward two years ago.
Nay, I’ll conjure too!
The County will be here with music straight, For so he said he would.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.
Sojourn in Mantua.
All this is comfort.
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.
Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
Love’s heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun’s beams, Driving back shadows over louring hills.
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
What noise is here?
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
Did you ne'er hear say, “Two may keep counsel, putting one away”?
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty.
Is the day so young?
